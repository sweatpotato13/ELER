## About this repo

this repo has 4 schemes
* none-ring-based IND-CPA
* none-ring-based IND-CCA
* ring-based IND-CPA
* ring-based IND-CCA

IND-CPA scheme was implemented based on Public Key Cryptography

IND-CCA scheme was implemented based on KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism)

## Scheme

### none-ring-based
1.  Message Encoding
2.  Key Generation
3.  Encrypt
4.  Decrypt
5.  Encapsulation
6.  Decapsulation

### ring-based
1.  Message Encoding
2.  Key Generation
3.  Encrypt
4.  Decrypt
5.  Encapsulation
6.  Decapsulation
